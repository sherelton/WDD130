        <h2>Rivers</h2>
        <p>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the
          Salmon River. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago the River of No Return by the people living near it
          because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that
          they never left. Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are
          also commonly sighted.
          The river corridor is also lined with awe-inspiring ponderosa pine which towers over the sandy beaches in the
          campsites and provides shelter from sun or rain when needed. Let's not forget the rapids! They range from
          class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undamped rivers in the United States. As a free-flowing river,
          the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer.
          There are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late
          summer's slower, warmer water more. Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah Winding through canyons in central Utah,
          in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green River flows towards the mighty Colorado River and the
          sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous.
          This 84-mile trip runs from Sand Wash to Swaseyâ€™s Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding
          scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great
          whitewater opportunities. Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days Desolation Canyon
          has been recognized as a National Landmark. This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that
          the canyon tells.

        <h2>Rivals</h2>
        <p>Absolutely Rafting Activities is a good trip for children and adults of all ages. We have found however that
          children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their
          children are all over 8). A common concern we get from parents is that their children will be bored and stuck
          on a boat for hours at a time.
          Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of any age. The areas we are rafting through are some of the
          most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you might see around any corner. Not to mention the
          rapids which keep things very interesting. Each boat also comes equipped with a guide. It has been proven that
          river guides cannot go for very long without telling stories...some of which are even true! As with all
          adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk.
          To help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First Aid and all start with at least 3
          years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land. Everyone
          on commercial rafting trips wears a coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation device (PFD). Many no
          swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. Your guide will give you an in-depth and engaging safety
          talk before your trip begins explaining what you should prepare for and do in the event that you fall out of
          the raft.

        <h2>Rafting</h2>
        <p>Let's describe a common day on the river. Arise in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent
          sleeping under a beautiful starry sky. Have a hearty warm breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes or omelets to
          order, then pack your things and prepare for the day. The day is filled with some combination of swift water,
          rapids, calms, hikes, history, geology, stories, and more good food. We try to hit camp around 4 or 5, after
          setting up your cot you can relax with a good book or good company by the river, or explore around camp while
          your guides prepare your dinner...something perhaps like steak and potatoes, or grilled salmon...and Dutch
          oven brownies...you won't forget the Dutch oven brownies.
          After dinner it's more relaxing, and you might even be able to talk your guide into another story or two to
          send you off to bed under more stars than you thought were possible. If you have specific dates you need, we
          recommend booking a year in advance. If you can be more flexible 6 months in advance is usually sufficient.
          The most effective way to plan for temperature and weather changes in the Canyon is to be prepared for both
          hot & dry and cold & wet Rain jacket and rain pants- do not bring ponchos Quick dry shirts and shorts long
          sleeve cotton shirt and pants- helps keep your cooler on hot days. Button-down shirts provide more sun
          protection on the neck Light Weight Cotton Pant, Nylon Pants or Sarongs the best thing for men to wear are
          swim trunks as shorts if you are cold-natured, bring polypropylene long underwear top and bottom Women wear
          swimsuits or quick dry underwear and sports bras as a base layer during the day.
